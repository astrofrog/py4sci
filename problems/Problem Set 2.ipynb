      "Using this module, and what we have learned so far, write a function that will simulate randomly rolling two dice (each with 6 faces) and will return the two values. Then, simulate 10000 throws, and for each throw find out what the sum of the two dice is. After the loop, print out what fraction of the time each sum was produced (there are 11 possibilities for the sum, from 2 to 12). The output should be formatted similar to:\n",
