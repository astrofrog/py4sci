    "Cryptography is the study of how to make messages secret or how to read secret messages. A very simple encryption technique is called the *Caesar cipher*, which you can read up more about [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). The basic idea is that each letter is replaced by a letter that is a certain number of letters away, so for example if the shift was 2, then A would become C, B would become D, etc. (and Z will become B)."

One is to use the built-in functions ``chr`` and ``ord`` (and remember you can find out more about a function by using ``?`` in IPython). Another is to set up the alphabet in a string and use item access (``[4]``) to convert from numbers to letters, and the ``index`` method to convert from letters to numbers."
