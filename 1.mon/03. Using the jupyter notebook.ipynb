    "The IPython *notebook* is a new feature that has been implemented into IPython, and allows you to write notebooks similar to e.g. Mathematica. The advantage of doing this is that you can include text, code, and plots in the same document. This makes it ideal for example to write up a report about a project that uses mostly Python code, in order to share with others. In fact, the notes for this course are written using the IPython notebook!"
