      "1. Write a ``Particle`` class that can be used to represent a particle with a mass, a 3-d position, and a 3-d velocity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Write a method that can be used to compute the kinetic energy of the particle\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Write a method that takes another particle as an argument and finds the distance between the two particles\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Write a method that given a time interval ``dt`` will update the position of the particle to the new position based on the current position and velocity.\n",

      "5. Write a ``ChargedParticle`` class that inherits from the ``Particle`` class, but also has an attribute for the charge of the particle.\n",

      "6. Write examples of using these classes to test that the methods are working correctly."
