    "This problem set is about DNA data and methods typically applied to this kind of data. As a reminder, [DNA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) is a molecule that encodes genetic instructions for living organisms. DNA is typically found as a double-stranded helix, in which each strand corresponds to a sequence of *nucleotides*. Each nucleotide consists of a nucleobase (guanine, adenine, thymine, or cytosine) attached to sugars, which are in turn separated from each other by phosphate groups:\n",

    "When the mRNA is translated to a protein sequence, each set of three nucleotides, called a **codon**, is translated into a single amino acid. For example, the codon ``UUC`` translates to the amino acid *Phenylalanine*. Each amino acid can be represented by a single letter - for example Phenylalanine is represented by the letter ``F``. A protein, which is formed from a sequence of amino acids, can therefore be written as a sequence of letters in the same way as DNA or mRNA, but using more of the letters of the alphabet since there are more than four amino acids.\n",
