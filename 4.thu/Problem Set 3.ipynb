    "In this problem set, we are going to investigate a dataset that contains the *radial velocity* of a star at various points in time. The radial velocity is the velocity with which the star is moving towards or away from us (positive velocities indicate it is moving away from us).\n",
    "\n",
    "If a star is not close to any other objects, there is no reason why the radial velocity should change over time. However, in the case where a second object is orbiting a star (such as a planet or another star), the star and the object will both orbit the center of mass of system. Therefore, the star will show periodic variations in its velocity over time. These changes in velocity then cause a shift in spectral lines via the Doppler effect, which we can measure with telescopes that have state-of-the art spectrographs. The smaller the second object, the less the star will be affected. For example, the Earth causes the Sun to change its velocity with an amplitude of 0.1 m/s over 1 year.\n",
