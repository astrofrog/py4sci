The data consists of maps of the concentration of ice in the Arctic collected between 2006 and 2011. I have downloaded and extracted the maps from [here](http://www.iup.uni-bremen.de/seaice/amsr/) and have put them in a format that you can more easily used (if you are interested in using the raw data directly, let me know and I can show you).\n",

Note that to get the correct orientation, you will need to call the ``imshow`` command with the ``origin='lower'`` option, which ensures that the (0,0) pixels is on the bottom left, not the top left. You can try and use different colormaps if you like (set by the ``cmap`` option) - see [here](http://matplotlib.org/examples/color/colormaps_reference.html) for information on the available colormaps. You can specify a colormap to use with e.g. ``cmap=plt.cm.jet`` (i.e. ``cmap=plt.cm.`` followed by the name of the colormap). Note that you can make figures larger by specifying e.g.\n",

Remember that you can always look at the examples in the [Matplotlib Gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) to find examples. You can also try and remove the tick labels (``100``, ``200``, etc.) since they are not useful - but don't worry if you can't figure out how."

    "We now want to make a plot of the ice concentration over time. Reading in a single map is easy, but since we have 137 maps, we do not want to read them all in individually by hand. **Write a loop over all the available files, and inside the loop, read in the data to a variable (e.g. ``data``), and also extract the year, month, and day as integer values (e.g. ``year``, ``month``, and ``day``)**. Then, also inside the loop, **compute a variable ``time``** which is essentially the fractional time in years (so 1st July 2012 is 2012.5). You can assume for simplicity that each month has 30 days - this will not affect the results later. Finally, also **compute for each file the total number of pixels that have a value above 50%**. After the loop, **make a plot of the number of pixels with a concentration above 50% against time**.\n",

However, we first need to know the area of the pixels in the image, and since we are looking at a projection of a spherical surface, each pixel will be a different area. The areas (in km^2) are contained inside the file named ``ice_data_area.npy``. **Read in the areas and make a plot (with colorbar) to see how the pixel area is changing over the image.**\n",

However, it is worth noting that the minimum ice coverage you found here was a record minimum - never before (in recorded history) had the size of the ice shelf been so small. This is part of a long term trend due to global warming. In 2012, the record was again beaten, and most scientists believe that by ~2050, the Arctic will be completely ice-free for at least part of the summer."
