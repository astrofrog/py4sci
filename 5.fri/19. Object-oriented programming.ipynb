      "Object-oriented programming is a way of programming that groups together related data and functions into **objects**, and makes it easier to design more complex programs. In traditional (procedural) programming, you can typically think of a program as an set of instructions that is read from top to bottom, with the exception of functions, which allow you to avoid repetitive code. In object-oriented programming, one instead thinks of a program mainly as setting up a number of 'types' of objects, and doing operations on them.\n",
